**Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment**
Before you start, make sure you have a text editor (like Visual Studio Code) installed on your computer.

**Step 2: Create a Project Folder**
Create a new folder for your portfolio project. This is where you'll store all your HTML, CSS, and other files.

**Step 3: Create HTML File**
Inside your project folder, create an `index.html` file. This will be the main page of your portfolio.

**Step 4: Write HTML Structure**
Open `index.html` in your text editor and add the following basic HTML structure:

index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Name - Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Your Name</h1>
        <p>Student &amp; Developer</p>
    </header>
    <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <!-- Add your project details here -->
    </section>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 Your Name</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>


**Step 5: Create CSS File**
Inside your project folder, create a `style.css` file for styling your portfolio.

**Step 6: Write CSS Styles**
Open `style.css` and add basic CSS to style your portfolio, you can add more styles if you want:

```css
/* Reset some default styles */
body, h1, h2, p {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

/* Global styles */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    color: #333;
    line-height: 1.6;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

header {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 50px;
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: #fff;
}

#projects {
    padding: 20px;
}

footer {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
}
```

**Step 7: Add Project Details**
Inside the `<section id="projects">` tag in your `index.html`, add details about your projects. You can use the following structure for each project:

```html
<div class="project">
    <h3>Project Title</h3>
    <p>Description of the project.</p>
    <a href="project-link">View Project</a>
</div>
```

**Step 8: Test Locally**
Open `index.html` in your web browser to see how your portfolio looks.

**Step 9: Create a GitHub Repository**
Go to GitHub and log in to your account. Click the "+" sign in the upper right corner and select "New Repository." Follow the instructions to create a new repository for your portfolio.

**Step 10: Push Your Code to GitHub**
Follow the instructions provided by GitHub to push your code to the repository you just created. This usually involves running a few commands in your terminal.

**Step 11: Set Up GitHub Pages**
In your repository on GitHub, go to the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and choose the "main" branch as the source. This will host your portfolio as a static website using GitHub Pages.

**Step 12: Access Your Portfolio**
Once GitHub Pages has built your site (it might take a few minutes), you can access your portfolio at `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname`.

Congratulations! You've now created a simple self-portfolio web page using HTML and CSS and deployed it on GitHub Pages. This is a great starting point, and you can continue to customize and expand your portfolio as you learn more about web development.
